### **About the commit messages**

The message is written using the following pattern:

```
#numberOfCommit - Add folderNumber/file-Name
```

Example:

The ninth commit, uploading the file from the folder 'exercicios-01', saved as 'name-lenght'

The commit message would be

```
#09 - Add 01/name-lenght
```

This pattern is not valid for the commits created in the test folder, exercicios-00.
